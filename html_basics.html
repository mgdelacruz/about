        <h1>HTML BASICS</h1>

        <h3>Paragraphs</h3>
        <p>This is a paragraph. HTML paragraphs are defined with the &lt;p&gt; tag</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Headings</h3>
        <p>HTML headings are defined with the &lt;h1&gt; to &lt;h6&gt; tags. &lt;h1&gt; defines the most important heading. &lt;h6&gt; defines the least important heading:</p>
        <h1>This is HEADING 1</h1>
        <h2>This is HEADING 2</h2>
        <h3>This is HEADING 3</h3>
        <h4>This is HEADING 4</h4>
        <h5>This is HEADING 5</h5>
        <h6>This is HEADING 6</h6>

        <p>Note: closing paragraphs and headers automatically appends breaks</p>
        <br>
        
        <h3>Links</h3>
        <p>HTML links are defined with the &lt;a &gt;tag:</p>
        <a href="https://www.w3schools.com"> This is a link to the website I used as a resource</a>
        <p>The link's destination is specified in the href attribute.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Entities</h3>
        <p>The less than and greater than signs displayed on this page, as well as the ampersands below, used character entities as these are reserved characters in HTML.
        A character entity looks like this:</p>
        <p> &amp;entity_name; OR &amp;#entity_number;</p>
        <p>Note: Browsers may not support all entity names, but the support for entity numbers is good.</p>
        <br>

        <h3>Images</h3>
        <img src="images/lenna.png" alt="lenna" width="480" height="480">
        <p>HTML images are defined with the &lt;img&gt; tag. The source file (src), alternative text (alt), width, and height are provided as attributes.</p>

        <hr>
        <p>Note: This is a horizontal rule defined by the  &lt;hr&gt;tag</p>
 
        <h1> HTML Display </h1>
        <p> Browsers automatically remove any extra spaces and lines when the page is displayed.
        Thus, making the use of &lt;br&gt; to start a new lines without starting a new paragraph necessary.
        On the other hand, in the case that we do need to preserve spaces and line breaks such as in displaying poems,
        we can make us of &lt;pre&gt; which defines preformatted text. To demonstrate we have this following example: </p>

        <pre>
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
                    
        My Bonnie lies over the sea.
                    
        My Bonnie lies over the ocean.
                    
        Oh, bring back my Bonnie to me.
        </pre>

        <h1>HTML Styles</h1>
        
        <p>The HTML style attribute has the following syntax:</p>
        <h4>&lt; tagname style = "property:value;" &gt; </h4>

        <p>Styles can be applied to an entire page or just single elements.
        It is neater to have a seperate file for styles. Here are some possible display modifications we can do:</p>
        <br>
        <p style ="background-color:powderblue;"> apply a background color </p>
        <p style ="color:tomato;"> change the text color </p>
        <p style ="font-family:cursive;"> change the text font</p>
        <p style ="font-size:150%;"> change the text size</p>
        <p style ="text-align:center;"> set the alignment </p>
        <br>
